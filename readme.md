# Onkey api sandbox

## Introduction

This application serves as a sample application on how to use the On Key api.

This includes subjects like:

1. Fetching data
1. Updating data
1. Performing actions on the server

This application uses simple UI to minimize dependency and implimintation noise.  
For simplifying things we will however use the crs-binding engine.

This application is also build on the crs application template found at
